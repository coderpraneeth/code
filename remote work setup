Hereâ€™s the simplified format:

What to Install:
	1.	VPN Client (e.g., Cisco AnyConnect)
	2.	SSH Client (e.g., PuTTY)
	3.	RDP Client (Microsoft Remote Desktop)
	4.	Database Client (e.g., MySQL Workbench, pgAdmin)
	5.	Firewall Settings (Allow necessary ports)

What to Request from IT Department:
	1.	VPN Access (Credentials and server address)
	2.	SSH Key (If required for remote systems)
	3.	RDP Access (IP, port, and credentials)
	4.	Database Credentials (For connection to systems)
	5.	Firewall Exceptions (For VPN, RDP, database ports)

This should cover the main steps.

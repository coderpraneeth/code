If the systems are hosted in the cloud, the credential list may change slightly depending on the cloud provider (AWS, Azure, GCP, etc.) and the database service used (RDS, Aurora, etc.). Hereâ€™s a sample for a cloud-hosted system:
	1.	Hostname: mydb.cluster-123456789012.us-west-2.rds.amazonaws.com (Example for AWS RDS)
	2.	Port: 3306 (or another port based on your DB type)
	3.	Username: db_admin
	4.	Password: SecureP@ssw0rd
	5.	Database Name: customer_db
	6.	Schema: public
	7.	SSL Certificate: ssl_certificate_url (if required, you may need to download it from the cloud provider)
	8.	VPC/Subnet: subnet-xyz (for systems within a VPC, if necessary)

Let me know if you need specifics for a particular cloud provider or database!
